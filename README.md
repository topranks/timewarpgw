# timewarpgw
Network lab to test the premise of Anycast GW without EVPN

## Background

Daniel asked an interesting question on Twitter recently 

I think he took the question to mean "why wouldn't anycast gw work in the typical enterprise configuration of years past".  Whereas I took the question more to mean "why do we need EVPN to make this possible?"
